# Effekt Website
Website of the effekt language

## SBT Microsites

The initial version of the website was generated by [sbt-microsites](https://47degrees.github.io/sbt-microsites/) (Â© 2019 [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/)). We then moved to directly editing the generated Jekyll code for more flexibility.

### How to Update the Effekt Compiler / LSP Server
The website features an interactive REPL and editor. In order to update the
underlying compiler, run the following commands.

1. In the effekt repo:
```
sbt> project effektJS
effektJS> fullOptJS
[info] Full optimizing ./js/target/scala-2.13/effekt-opt.js
```

2. Move the resulting `effekt-opt.js` to `src/effekt.js` in the website repo.

3. In the website repo, run `webpack`:
```
> webpack
```

This will generate a bunch of packed js files.
